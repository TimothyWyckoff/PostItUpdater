# PostItUpdater
This is a screen shot reading bot to update Microsoft's post-it note program with the information I need.

It takes a series of screen shots and using openCV determines a starting state, 
the position of post its, what is on each post it already and what is on my screen, 
this project is really just for my own use but will read a website containg various job info, 
keep track of changes to that website and place post its with technition information to help me keep track of where everyone is. 
This is exactly the way it was done by hand when I started here and it seemed like a fun challenge.

More updates to come...
